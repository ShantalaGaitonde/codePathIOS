## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
The list of my favorite apps are:
1. Whatsapp
    1. You can know if the message sent has reached the receiver by the double tick mark and also if the receiver has seen the message by   
       the blue tick.
    2. Different colors for the messages sent and received. 
2. Facebook
    1. Facebook market place where you can connect with the seller or buyer.
    2. Birthday reminders in the notification.

  App Idea:
  I would like to build a chat application similar to whatsapp. The app should be able to send text, images and videos.
